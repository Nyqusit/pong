Simple pong game

This is a very simple game made with HTML 5 and javascript. I went into making this game with no idea how the original Pong game was made. The games works but has some small bugs. The ball only travels in four different directions: northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest. I hope to recreate this game to work like the actual pong game sometime in the future.

HOW TO PLAY:
-click the HTML file to launch the game in your defualt browser
-"z" and "a" keys to control left player,"/" and ";" keys control right player
